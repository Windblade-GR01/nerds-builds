	"Overview"		"Dark Willow (aka Sylph) is an intelligence hero, who provides a lot of disables in fights and hard to bully out of lane. She has a great escape/zoning tool, as well as a lot of ways to setup kills, deal massive amounts of magic damage and provide utility in temfights.

This build is based on my own (~47th on Dotabuff) experience of playing the hero.

The build is part of Nerd's Hero Build Project. Other builds and additional information: http://dotablog.ileamare.ru/builds"

			"item_wind_lace"		"You're pretty slow hero anyway, so early Wind Lace will be really helpful. You can use it while upgrading Urn as well."
			"item_arcane_boots"		"You will have mana issues early, while also wanting to get Greaves, so Arcane boots seems like most optimal choice."
			"item_spirit_vessel"		"Armor, percentage base heal/damage, HP and movement speed. Pretty much all you may ask for."
			"item_cyclone"		"Mobility and mana, additional save as well as setup for your Q or E  (use E, wait for around 1.5 seconds, use eul)."
			"item_force_staff"		"Saves allies and works great in combo with your Q"
			"item_guardian_greaves"		"Your low armor makes this item pretty good for you: additional regen, arnor and overall strong aura for your team"
			"item_ancient_janggo"		"May be good early as additional mobility item"
			"item_nullifier"		"Additional strong lockdown, while also giving armor and high damage (works great on lvl 25)"
			"item_hurricane_pike"		"Natural upgrade for Force Staff"
			"item_octarine_core"		"Replacement for Kaya in case if you don't need Scythe or Shiva"

			"dark_willow_cursed_crown"		"It's incredibly strong ability, but we don't really need to max it early on: value point is enough. You main combo should be E+Q+charge W and attack with Bedlam."
			"special_bonus_gold_income_15"		"40 movement speed could be better for Core, but since you're playing support, additional GPM will be handy"
			"special_bonus_unique_dark_willow_1"		"Since you're building a lot of mobility and surviveability, you won't really need Spell Lifesteal anyway, while buff to your main spell will make you way stronger."
			"special_bonus_attack_speed_200"		"With this talent you can become another core for your team, while additional second to a spell that won't be really useful most of the times won't change anything."
			"special_bonus_cast_range_125"		"Even while Sylph already has a lot of cast range, this talent will be way more helpful for a squishy support (so you won't be catched off guard)"
